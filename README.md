# Swisstronik Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It is a simple contract that writes and reads a message, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
